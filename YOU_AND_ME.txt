I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight

You know I got ya
Ain't nobody got you like that
Ain't nobody gonna have your back like the way I do
Love me, just say you do
You know you got me
Everything I do, everything I did
Everything I wished I was will make me feel alright
I'm just saying, so

I really like it
Nothing in the world could make me feel
The way you do, the things you do
I really like it
Nothing in the world could make me feel
The way you do, the things you do

I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight

Look at you, now look at me
Are you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?
Look at you, now look at me
Are you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?

Your love makes my heart skips struck
Just a little touch, my world stops
Finally, I know that you're mine
I don't wanna fall
Don't wanna play this game of love, oh-eh-oh
There's no way to hide
