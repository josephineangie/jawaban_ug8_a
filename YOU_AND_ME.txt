I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight

Look at you, now look at me
Are you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?
Look at you, now look at me
Are you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?
